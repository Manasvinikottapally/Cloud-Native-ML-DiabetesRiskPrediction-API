# Diabetes Risk Prediction - ML API (Project Week 1)

This project uses the Pima Indians Diabetes dataset to train a machine learning model that predicts the likelihood of diabetes based on patient health features.

##  Tech Stack
- Python
- Pandas, scikit-learn
- Virtualenv
- joblib (for saving model)

##  Files
- `train_model.py`: trains and saves a Random Forest model
- `diabetes.csv`: input dataset
- `diabetes_model.pkl`: saved model file (ignored in Git)

##  Next Steps
- Build FastAPI app for predictions
- Dockerize and deploy on Kubernetes
- CI/CD with Jenkins
- Cloud deployment on AWS/GCP

# Cloud-Native-ML-DiabetesRiskPrediction-API

A FastAPI-based RESTful service that predicts diabetes risk using a trained machine learning model. The application is containerized with Docker for consistent, portable deployment.
